[Moin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moin) there! My name is Merlin. This site is my attempt to finally start writing a tech-blog after growing up with Linux and many years of tinkering with technology, especially DevOps, system administration, network administration, programming, and a bit of data science.

I have finished getting my masters's degree in Computer Sciences at the [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/en/), and am currently working in the IT department of a bank, administering various AIX and Linux systems. In the meantime I am working on my Homelab, partially to learn new technologies, partially to train for future certifications.

My main points of interest are getting enterprise-grade-technology to run in here, explore the limits of what things you can do with soft- and hardware, but mostly do dumb things that come to my mind.

You can also find me on [Mastodon](https://toot.kif.rocks/@ruhrscholz) and [GitHub](https://github.com/merlinscholz).
