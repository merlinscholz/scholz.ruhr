# [Moin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moin) there! I'm Merlin (he/him)

Sysadmin and application engineer from the Ruhrpott, Germany.

## Tech

At day I work in the IT department of a huge banking organization. My role involves managing a range of systems, from legacy AIX to modern Kubernetes applications.

Before that I studied computer science at the TU Dortmund, where I got my bachelor's and master's degrees.

## Writing

While I can't share too many details about my work, I can write about how I spend my free time tinkering with my Homelab. This allows me to explore new technologies, self-host various services, and occasionally break things for fun.

## Projects

While my main project all the time is probably the [ever-evolving homelab](/projects/homelab), there have been some smaller experiments in the past.
