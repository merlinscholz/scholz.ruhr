[Moin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moin) there! My name is Merlin Scholz. This site is my attempt to finally start writing a tech-blog after growing up with Linux and many years of tinkering with technology, especially devops, system administrationa, programming, and a little bit of data science.

I have just finished getting my bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Sciences at the [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/), and am currently applying to study for a master's degree.

Meanwhile I am working on my Homelab, partially to learn new technologies, partially to train for future certifications. My main points of interest are getting enterprise-grade-technology to run in here, and just to explore the limits of what things you can do with soft- and hardware.

Also, I am an advocate of open-source software and privacy, but I think that is obvious when working in this field.
