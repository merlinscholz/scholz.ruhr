Hey there! I'm Merlin (he/him). A sysadmin and application engineer from Germany.

At day I work in the IT department of a huge banking organization. My role involves managing a range of systems, from legacy AIX to modern Kubernetes applications.

Before that I studied computer science at the TU Dortmund, where I got my bachelor's and master's degrees.

While I can't share too many details about my work, I can write about how I spend my free time tinkering with my Homelab. This allows me to explore new technologies, self-host various services, and occasionally break things for fun.
