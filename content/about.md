### About me

My name is Merlin Scholz. mscholz.dev is my attempt to finally start writing a tech-blog after many years of tinkering with technology, especially dev-ops.

I am currently studying Applied Computer Sciences in Germany, trying to get by bachelor's degree. Meanwhile I am working on my Homelab, partially to learn new technologies, partially to train for certifications.
