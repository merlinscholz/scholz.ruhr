## About me

My name is Merlin Scholz. mscholz.dev is my attempt to finally start writing a tech-blog after many years of tinkering with technology, especially dev-ops.

I am currently studying Applied Computer Sciences in Germany, trying to get by bachelor's degree. Meanwhile I am working on my Homelab, partially to learn new technologies, partially to train for certifications.

## About this blog

This blog is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with my [Klarheit Theme](https://github.com/m-scholz/klarheit) which is based on the [Project Clarity](https://clarity.design) design system. Hosting is provided by GitHub pages, and for the privacy-focused folks: This page runs entirely without JavaScript.

## Contact

I am currently working on providing a contact solution that does not compromise my email address for bots to get. This should be finished in a few days.
