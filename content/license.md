    Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
    does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
    Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
    other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

    Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
    conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
    original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
    and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
    following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

        Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
        intended for use by those authorized to give the public
        permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
        copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
        irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
        and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
        Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
        applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
        material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
        material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
        licensed material, or material used under an exception or
        limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

        Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
        licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
        licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
        the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
        example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
        copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
        licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
        other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
        the licensed material may still be restricted for other
        reasons, including because others have copyright or other
        rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
        such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
        Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
        respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
        for the public:

    By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
    to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
    Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License
    ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be
    interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
    consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the
    Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the
    Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under
    these terms and conditions.

        Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material

        arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
        permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
        Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
        Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,

        Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
        categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
        specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
        Rights.

    e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
        absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
        fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
        Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
        agreements.

        file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
        no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
        exchange.

    l. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
        process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
        as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
        dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
        available to the public including in ways that members of the
        public may access the material from a place and at a time
        individually chosen by them.

    m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
        resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

        under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


    Section 2 -- Scope.

    a. License grant.

        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

                a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

                b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
                NonCommercial purposes only.

        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
            its terms and conditions.

        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            6(a).

        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
            (4) never produces Adapted Material.

        5. Downstream recipients.

                a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.

                b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.

                c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.

        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

    b. Other rights.

        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
            Rights, but not otherwise.

        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
            Public License.

        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
            reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
            the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
            purposes.


    Section 3 -- License Conditions.

    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
    following conditions.

    a. Attribution.

        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:

                a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:

                    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                        Material and any others designated to receive
                        attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                        the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                        designated);

                    ii. a copyright notice;

                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                        warranties;

                    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                        extent reasonably practicable;

                b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

                c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.

        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
            reasonably practicable.

    b. ShareAlike.

        In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
        Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
            license with the same License Elements, this version or
            later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.

        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
            Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
            in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
            context in which You Share Adapted Material.

        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
            or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
            Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
            rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


    Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
    apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
        to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
        portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
        only;

    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
        contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
        Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
        Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
        including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
        all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
    Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


    Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
        EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
        AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
        ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
        IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
        WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
        ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
        KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
        ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
        TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
        NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
        COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
        USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
        DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
        IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
        above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
        possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
        waiver of all liability.


    Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
        Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
        this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
        terminate automatically.

    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
        Section 6(a), it reinstates:

        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
            violation; or

        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
        right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
        of this Public License.

    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
        will not terminate this Public License.

    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
        License.


    Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
        terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
        Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
        independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


    Section 8 -- Interpretation.

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
        shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
        conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
        be made without permission under this Public License.

    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
        deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
        minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
        cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
        without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
        conditions.

    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
        failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
        Licensor.

    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
        as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
        that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
        processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

    This European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as defined
    below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work,
    other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such
    use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

    The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
    defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
    copyright notice for the Work:

            Licensed under the EUPL

    or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL.

    In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

    - ‘The Licence’: this Licence.

    - ‘The Original Work’: the work or software distributed or communicated by the
    Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable
    Code as the case may be.

    - ‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the
    Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence
    does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work
    required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is
    determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.

    - ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.

    - ‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
    convenient for people to study and modify.

    - ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and which is
    meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

    - ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates
    the Work under the Licence.

    - ‘Contributor(s)’: any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the
    Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.

    - ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of
    the Work under the terms of the Licence.

    - ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,
    renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
    available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its
    essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
    person.

    2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

    The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested
    in the Original Work:

    - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
    - reproduce the Work,
    - modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
    - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display
    the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may
    be, the Work,
    - distribute the Work or copies thereof,
    - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
    - sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.

    Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
    known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

    In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
    exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective
    the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

    The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights to
    any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the
    rights granted on the Work under this Licence.

    3. Communication of the Source Code

    The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
    Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
    provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
    along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in
    a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where
    the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor
    continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

    4. Limitations on copyright

    Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from
    any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the
    Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations
    thereto.

    5. Obligations of the Licensee

    The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
    obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

    Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
    trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
    disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a
    copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or
    communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
    notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.

    Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the
    Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be
    done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence
    unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the
    Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee
    (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on
    the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.

    Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative
    Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed under
    a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the
    terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, ‘Compatible
    Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence.
    Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with
    his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible
    Licence shall prevail.

    Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work,
    the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate
    a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long
    as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

    Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,
    trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for
    reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
    reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

    6. Chain of Authorship

    The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
    hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
    power and authority to grant the Licence.

    Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings
    to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
    power and authority to grant the Licence.

    Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
    Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
    terms of this Licence.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty

    The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
    Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
    ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.

    For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’ basis
    and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without
    limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects
    or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than
    copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

    This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition
    for the grant of any rights to the Work.

    8. Disclaimer of Liability

    Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
    persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
    material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use
    of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
    stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
    damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
    However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as
    far such laws apply to the Work.

    9. Additional agreements

    While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement,
    defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if
    accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor,
    and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
    for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by
    the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.

    10. Acceptance of the Licence

    The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I agree’
    placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by
    affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of
    applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable
    acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

    Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
    conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence,
    such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the
    Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

    11. Information to the public

    In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic
    communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a
    remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must
    at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law
    regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded,
    stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

    12. Termination of the Licence

    The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
    any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

    Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
    received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
    remain in full compliance with the Licence.

    13. Miscellaneous

    Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
    agreement between the Parties as to the Work.

    If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
    law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
    whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it
    valid and enforceable.

    The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of
    this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required and
    reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New
    versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.

    All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,
    have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of
    their choice.

    14. Jurisdiction

    Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,

    - any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising
    between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a
    Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court
    of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty on
    the Functioning of the European Union,

    - any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the
    interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary
    business.

    15. Applicable Law

    Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,

    - this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State
    where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,

    - this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,
    residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.
