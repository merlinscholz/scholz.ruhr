[Moin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moin) there! My name is Merlin. This site is my attempt to finally start writing a tech-blog after growing up with Linux and many years of tinkering with technology, especially devops, system administration, programming, and a bit of data science.

I have just finished getting my bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Sciences at the [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/en), and am currently working on my master's degree.

In the meantime I am working on my Homelab, partially to learn new technologies, partially to train for future certifications. My main points of interest are getting enterprise-grade-technology to run in here, and just to explore the limits of what things you can do with soft- and hardware.
